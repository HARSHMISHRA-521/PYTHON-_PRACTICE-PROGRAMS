"""Docstring is a short form of documentation string. Its purpose is to give the programmer
 a brief knowledge about the functionality of the function. It must be the first string in a 
 function, and it is also an optional string but always good to have it while working on programs
  having multiple functions. The syntax for writing a docstring is very simple as it is just a string 
  written in between three double quotes placed three times (""" """) on either side of the string.
   But it has to be the first line of code in the functionâ€™s body. To call a docstring we write the 
   name of the function followed by ._doc_."""
